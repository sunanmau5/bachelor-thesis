\chapter{Methodology}
In the following chapter, the component analysis is defined first. This results in the requirements that must be considered in the design when implementing the extension, which is then discussed in the third section. In the final section, the tests, to ensure that the extension matches the expected requirements and it is defect free, are described.

\section{Requirements Elicitation and Analysis}
The extension is used to improve the user's experience when navigating through an e-commerce website to search for a wanted product or service. The idea is to integrate the end user's browser with an extension, which will record the host name or domain of the visited website's URL along with the respective parameters. When enough records have been collected, the extension will display a list of parameters for the visited domain. Path parameters and query parameters will be separated from these parameters. The user can then navigate through the path parameters in the same way that they would navigate through a file system. When the last path parameter is reached, the query parameters and the number of times these parameters are called in the URL are displayed. Below the list is an input field and a button; these input fields will be filled based on and while navigating through the selected parameters. When the "Navigate" button is clicked, a new tab will open with the full-path built URL.

These prerequisites and considerations result in the following requirements for the extension, which is to be developed within the scope of this thesis. These requirements are classified into functional and non-functional requirements.

\subsection{Functional Requirements}
A requirement is called functional if its underlying need is functional, i.e., it relates to information processing objects (data, operations, behavior). In other words, functional requirements are statements of services the system should provide, how the system should react to particular inputs and how the system should behave in particular situations \autocite{sommerville2011software}. The following functional requirements are defined for the extension:

\begin{itemize}
  \item FR-01: User can see how many times each query parameters for each host name are used
  \item FR-02: User can build a URL query string based on their history
  \item FR-03: User can navigate to the URL with the built query string
\end{itemize}

In addition to functional requirements, non-functional requirements are also defined as follows.

\subsection{Non-Functional Requirements}
A requirement is called non-functional if its underlying need is a non-objective property. In other words non-functional requirementes are constraints on the services or functions offered by the system such as timing constraints, constraints on the development process, standards, etc \autocite{sommerville2011software}. It often apply to the system as a whole rather than individual features or services. The following non-functional requirements arise for the extension to be developed:

\begin{itemize}
  \item NFR-01: UI components must be implemented using React.
  \item NFR-02: TypeScript must be used to implement dynamic functions.
  \item NFR-02: Data must be saved on the end-user's Chrome storage.
  \item NFR-03: Both the external components used and the developed component itself must be well documented.
  \item NFR-04: The individual external libraries must be easy to update.
  \item NFR-05: Modularization must be taken into consideration throughout development so that individual modules and/or components can be easily reused, expanded or changed.
\end{itemize}

\section{Design Concept}
% TODO:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The initial purpose of the extension's development was to be an addition to marta's user application.
  \item What is the strategy? How did I solve the problem?
  \item But why should it be an extension?
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Individuality, give user the option to use or not to use
          \item Separate code
          \item Search and Filter is a general concept, by creating an extension it could be useful for users other than marta's customers
        \end{itemize}
  \item Implementation decisions, why use chrome.storage, why use react
  \item Introduce the simple software architecture
  \item Introduce the frontend react architecture
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Choice of Implementation Browser}
The selection of a browser was based on a number of factors. The first was the browser's usage rate. This is significant since anyone who doesn't already have the necessary browser will need to download and install it. Drop-outs due to the installation process or being unfamiliar with a new browser can significantly raise the cost of conducting the survey. The ease of use of the API and simplicity of implementation were additional crucial criteria. The extension programming process should ideally only need a basic understanding of the extension API. The capabilities of the API offered by the browser was another factor considered. The extension needs to:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Store a big amount of data on the client side
  \item Read URL - so query parameters can be passed to the extension
  \item Modify URL - so frequently used query parameters can be utilized
\end{enumerate}

%TODO: update texts
\textbf{[outdated]} Internet Explorer was the most challenging in terms of implementation simplicity. The features appeared to be restricted, and it needed knowledge of the COM. [8] After reviewing the documentation, it was still unclear how tasks like making HTTP queries or changing the DOM would be carried out. The instructions appears to be primarily concerned with optional features like adding menu items and explorer bars. Thus, IE was eliminated from the list, leaving Firefox and Chrome as the only options.

%TODO: update texts
\textbf{[outdated]} Both the Firefox and Chrome extension APIs had similar features. The fact that Firefox required knowing XUL (XML User Interface Language), Mozilla's XML-based language for creating application user interfaces, was one drawback. [9] Extensions for the Google Chrome browser can be created entirely in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The team members' familiarity with the languages and the simplicity of the solution were appealing. Additionally, it was discovered that the Chrome documentation was easy to grasp and was divided up into sections. Firefox's market share was roughly double that of Chrome. As a result, it was decided to develop a Google Chrome browser extension.
